## About
A nonlinear differential evolution algorithm for global optimization

## Usage
The main code is available in `differentialEvolution.m` file. There are options to specify various parameters in the `de.m` file. 

To run the program use:
```
> run
```
The default objective function used is in `config.csv`. Custom scheme can be specified in `de.m` under `options.use_mutation_scheme`. All the objective functions would be tested after a scheme is specified.
